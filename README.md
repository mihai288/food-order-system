# Food Order Application

This is a simple food ordering system built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to browse a menu, add items to their order, view their order summary, and submit their order. The application also features a system for administrators to view and manage orders in real-time.

## Features

- **User Interface**:
  - View the food menu with item names and prices.
  - Add items to the order.
  - View and remove items from the order.
  - See the total price of the order in real-time.
  - Submit the order and save it to a text file with order details.
  - View pending and completed orders.
  - 
- **Admin Interface**:
  - Mark orders as "completed/received" after they have been processed.
 
  User Interface - order_app.py, orders_screen.py
  Admin Interface - kitchen_app.py
  They have to run all the same time and they will update live by the .txt files
